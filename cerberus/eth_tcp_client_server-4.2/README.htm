<h2>AVR web server and web client, stack 3rd generation</h2>
The different examples and applications in this package are:
<br>
<ul>
<li>test_OKworks.hex  -- Example for a basic web server<br><br>
<li>basic_web_server_example.hex  -- Example for a web server<br><br>
<li>test_readSiliconRev.hex -- Prints the chip revision of the ENC<br><br>
<li>eth_rem_dev_tcp.hex (compiled from main.c) -- You can switch a relay  on or off a relay via a web-page or via a small udp application (see directory udpcom). The relay is connected via pin PD7. The default password is "secret".<br><br>
<li>test0.hex -- microcontroller test, causes an LED on PIN PB1 to blink<br><br>
<li>test_emailnotify.hex -- send email notifications when you connect PD6 to GND. You need a tuxgraphics microcontroller mail account to use this. There is a timeout of 3min to prevent too many mails.<br><br>
<li>test_twitter.hex -- post a message on twitter. To trigger the posting of a message you connect PD6 to GND. You need a twitter account to use this. There is a timeout of 3min to prevent too many posts. Note that twitter ignores repeated identical posts.<br><br>
<li>test_identi_ca.hex -- post a message on identi.ca. To trigger the sending of the message connect PD6 to GND. You need a identi.ca account to use this. There is a timeout of 3min to prevent too many posts.<br><br>

<b>!! READ THIS FIRST !!</b>
---------------------
! Edit the file C-file which you plan to compile and change the lines:
! static uint8_t mymac[6] = {0x54,0x55,0x58,0x10,0x00,0x29};
! static uint8_t myip[4] = {10,0,0,29};

In case of the web client applications  (test_web_client.c and test_emailnotify.c)
you will in addition need to edit the following lines:

! // IP address of the web server to contact (IP of the first portion of the URL):
! static uint8_t websrvip[4] = {77,37,2,152};
! // The name of the virtual host which you want to contact at 
! // websrvip (hostname of the first portion of the URL):
! #define WEBSERVER_VHOST "tuxgraphics.org"
! // Default gateway. The ip address of your DSL router. It can be set to the same as
! // websrvip the case where there is no default GW to access the
! // web server (=web server is on the same lan as this host)
! static uint8_t gwip[4] = {10,0,0,2};
! 

Check the file "Makefile" and make sure the MCU is set correctly:

! MCU=atmega168
! DUDECPUTYPE=m168
! or
! MCU=atmega88
! DUDECPUTYPE=m88
! or
! MCU=atmega328p
! DUDECPUTYPE=m328p

More information about Makefiles can be found at:
http://tuxgraphics.org/electronics/200912/makefiles.shtml

The code for only the web server fits into an atmega88 chip but
a combined web client and web server needs a atmega168 or atmega328p.

The ip_config.h is setup such that all functinallity used in the
examples is enabeled. This makes the code much bigger than needed
for a specific example such as (test_OKworks.c or main.c).

To fit the web server only applications into an atmega88 you need to 
compile web server only applications without linking the, in this case
useless, client code:
        Example for eth_rem_dev_tcp.hex:
        Edit ip_config.h . Uncomment WWW_client  and UDP_client
        Run
        make eth_rem_dev_tcp.hex
        to compile (you will see that the total size will be below 8kb)

For the first device you build you will not need to change the mymac line.
But you will probably need to change the IP address (myip). myip must be a
free address from the address range in your home network.

Example: you wlan router might have 192.168.1.1, your PC might have
192.168.1.2. This means you could e.g use 192.168.1.10 and leave some
room for more PCs. If you use DHCP then make sure that the address it not
double allocated (exclude it from the DHCP range).

You need an avr-gcc development environment in order to compile this.
See http://tuxgraphics.org/electronics/200901/avr-gcc-linux.shtml

To compile the final software use the command:
make

Note: windows users may use and modify the supplied winmake.bat to setup the
environment correctly.

The above command will compile the following hex files:
basic_web_server_example.hex  test_OKworks.hex      test_readSiliconRev.hex
eth_rem_dev_tcp.hex           test_emailnotify.hex  test_twitter.hex
test0.hex                     test_identi_ca.hex    test_web_client.hex

The command
make load

will execute the avrdude command to load the eth_rem_dev_tcp.hex software (remote relay
switch on/off software, compiled from main.c).
E.g something like: 
   avrdude -p m88 -c stk500v2 -e -U flash:w:eth_rem_dev_tcp.hex

To load any of the other software you can either execute the needed
avrdude command manually or use the load targets defined in the Makefile
which is load_ and then the name of the hex file without the .hex:
e.g 
make load_test_web_client

<br>Note your programmer might interfer with the enc28j60!</b> For the avrusb500
with 30cm cable you can normally leave the cable on. For all other programmers
it is however saver to remove the programmer cable and power down/up the device.
This is because the SPI interface is used for loading of the software and 
communication to the enc28j60.

To see a list of all possible build targets run the command:
make help

<b>
Selecting the right clock source
--------------------------------
</b>
Tuxgraphics hardware sold as of march 2007 is prepared to use the clock
signal from the enc28j60. To use this you need to change the 
low fuse byte once from 0x62 to 0x60:

avrdude -p m88 -c stk500v2 -u -v -U lfuse:w:0x60:m
or 
avrdude -p m168 -c stk500v2 -u -v -U lfuse:w:0x60:m
or 
avrdude -p m328p -c stk500v2 -u -v -U lfuse:w:0x60:m

or just type in your Linux shell:
make fuse

After programming the fuse settings of atmega168 and atmega88 should be:
 low fuse:  0x60
 high fuse: 0xdf
 ext. fuse: 0x01

For the atmega328p the hfuse and efuse bytes look slightly different.
The idea is however the same. Just change the lfuse from factory default
to 0x60. The fuse settings of the atmega328p are after programming
should be as below (default factory settings for atmega328p, the
efuse has some not used bits and is dependent on the chip revision):
 lfuse reads as 0x60
 hfuse reads as 0xD9
 efuse reads as 0x07

details of the lfuse bits:
  CKDIV8 = 0
  CKOUT  = 1
  SUT1   = 1
  SUT0   = 0
  CKSEL3 = 0
  CKSEL2 = 0
  CKSEL1 = 0
  CKSEL0 = 0

If you are unsure what the current fuse setting are on the atmega
then you can read the fuse settings with a command like:
          avrdude -p m168 -c stk500v2 -v -q
The result should be this (default factory settings for atmega168):
          avrdude: safemode: lfuse reads as 62
          avrdude: safemode: hfuse reads as DF
          avrdude: safemode: efuse reads as 1

The result should be this (default factory settings for atmega328p):
          avrdude: safemode: lfuse reads as 62
          avrdude: safemode: hfuse reads as D9
          avrdude: safemode: efuse reads as 7

<b>
Compiling on non-Unix systems
-----------------------------
</b>
Please use the provided Makefile !!!

It will also work under Windows.

Take a look at the supplied winmake.bat and winload.bat file. The bat script
might be needed to set the environment correctly.

A description of what makefiles are and how they work can be found at:
http://tuxgraphics.org/electronics/200912/makefiles.shtml

Edit the Makefile to make the needed adjustments at the top
of the file.

<b>
Using test_twitter to send messages to twitter
or using test_indenti_ca to send a message to indenti.ca
----------------------------------------------
</b>
The twitter example is test_twitter.c  The identi.ca file
is test_indenti_ca.c
You need to edit the file.
You need to change myip and gwip as described above and then
change this:

1) As of version 4.0 there is a small DNS resolver library
See dnslkup.h
IP addresses for twitter.com and identi.ca need no longer
to be hardcoded.


2) Username and password of your twitter account need to
  be encoded in a special way. Go to 
  <a href="http://tuxgraphics.org/~guido/javascript/base64-javascript.html">http://tuxgraphics.org/~guido/javascript/base64-javascript.html</a>
  and enter "username:youpassword"
  after that replace this "ZABcdefghijklmnop12345==" with your string:
  #define BLOGGACCOUNT "Authorization: Basic ZABcdefghijklmnop12345=="

  This base64-javascript encoder can also be found in the subdirectory "files".

3) Scroll further down into the code and look for:

  urlencode("Test of tuxgraphics eth board",&amp;(statusstr[7]);

  This is the status update that the ethernet board will send.
  You can change it. There is a 40 char limit but you could change the 
  definition of statusstr.

4) compile  with
  make test_twitter
or
  make test_identi_ca
  and download make test_twitter.hex to the board.
 
5) Connect PD6 to GND and watch your profile on twitter/identi.ca


<b>
Using test_emailnotify to receive email notifications
-----------------------------------------------------
</b>
To use this software you need to:

1) order a microcontroller email account at shop.tuxgraphics.org

2) edit test_emailnotify.c and search for the string gus123. Replace
this string by the microcontroller email account ID that you received.
Edit also the IP addresses as described at the beginning of this file.

3) edit the Makefile and uncomment the line
EMAIL=haveaccount

4) run make to compile the software

5) load the test_emailnotify.hex into the microccontroller

6) Connect PD6 with GND for a moment and ... you will get an email sent to 
the email address specified in your tuxgraphics microcontroller email account.
The destination email address is specified in the email account
and not in the test_emailnotify software to prevent SPAM and abuse.

<b>
UDP
---
</b>
The programs test_readSiliconRev and eth_rem_dev_tcp (compiled from main.c) can
also be used via UDP. All programs have a web interface.
---------------------------------------------------------
The test_readSiliconRev.c (compiles to load_readSiliconRev.hex) reads 
the enc28j60 silicon revision and displays it. 
You can use it as a base for a simple application
where you want to just read data (e.g thermometer)

make 
make load_readSiliconRev

Read via udp:
udpcom ver 10.0.0.29

will answer:
II: data: ver, ip: 10.0.0.29 port: 1200
OK: 10.0.0.29: ver=4

Read via webbrowser:
http://10.0.0.29

will display a webpage with:
ENC28J60 silicon rev is: 4

Using the eth_rem_dev_tcp with UDP
------------------------------
The only supported useful function in this release is to switch on or
of the transistor connected to PD7.
The command to switch on is: t=1
The command to switch off is: t=0
Query the status: t=?

The udpcom syntax is: udpcom password,X=Y IP-addr

Here is an example:
./udpcom/unix/udpcom secret,t=0 10.0.0.29
II: data: secret,t=0, ip: 10.0.0.29 port: 1200
OK: 10.0.0.29: t=0

./udpcom/unix/udpcom secret,t=1 10.0.0.29
II: data: secret,t=1, ip: 10.0.0.29 port: 1200
OK: 10.0.0.29: t=1

./udpcom/unix/udpcom secret,t=? 10.0.0.29
II: data: secret,t=?, ip: 10.0.0.29 port: 1200
OK: 10.0.0.29: t=1

./udpcom/unix/udpcom secret,t=0 10.0.0.29
II: data: secret,t=0, ip: 10.0.0.29 port: 1200
OK: 10.0.0.29: t=0

./udpcom/unix/udpcom secret,t=? 10.0.0.29
II: data: secret,t=?, ip: 10.0.0.29 port: 1200
OK: 10.0.0.29: t=0
